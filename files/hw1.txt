================= Problem 1: =================
Following is the result of run with problme size, N = 2^24.
copy to gpu took 5.9 ms
gpu shift cypher took 2.3 ms
copy from gpu took 3.6 ms
host shift cypher took 44.7 ms

From here, we can name each of the following as follows:
CPU Vairable Cost, CPU_vc = (host shift cypher time) = 44.7 ms
GPU Variable Cost, GPU_vc = (copy to gpu time) + (copy from gpu time) = 5.9 + 3.6 = 9.5 ms
GPU Fixed Cost, GPU_fc = (gpu shift cypher time) = 2.3 ms

Both CPU_vc and GPU_vc are linearly dependent on the size of the input, N.
=> CPU_vc = N/c1
=> GPU_vc = N/c2
Solving for c1, we get c1 = 2^24/44.7ms = 375,329
=> CPU_vc = N/375,329 ms

Solving for c2, we get c2 = 2^24/9.5ms = 1,766,023
=> GPU_vc = N/1,766,023 ms

GPU_fc is independent of the size of the input, N.
=> GPU_fc = 2.3 ms

Solving for N, such that total time cost of GPU and CPU is equivalent,
=> CPU_vc = GPU_vc + GPU_fc
=> N/375329 = N/1766023 + 2.3
=> N = 1,096,238 = 2^20

Thus the cross-over point is when N is around 2^20.

This was verified by running the code with N = 2^20 and N = 2^21.
Following were the results:

N = 2^21:
copy to gpu took 0.7 ms
gpu shift cypher took 3.8 ms
copy from gpu took 0.5 ms
host shift cypher took 6.3 ms

Total CPU time: 6.3 ms
Total GPU time: 0.7 + 3.8 + 0.5 = 5 ms

For N = 2^20:
copy to gpu took 0.3 ms
gpu shift cypher took 2.9 ms
copy from gpu took 0.3 ms
host shift cypher took 3.3 ms

Total CPU time: 3.3 ms
Total GPU time: 0.3 + 2.9 + 0.3 = 3.5 ms

For N = 2^19
copy to gpu took 0.2 ms
gpu shift cypher took 2.8 ms
copy from gpu took 0.2 ms
host shift cypher took 1.9 ms

Total CPU time: 1.9 ms
Total GPU time: 0.2 + 2.8 + 0.2 = 3.2 ms

From the above results, it is clear that the cross-over point is around 2^20.


================= Problem 2: =================
threadIdx.x is the index of the thread in the x-direction within the block
since it is multiplied by 3, that mean its max width in the x-direction is 3
threadIdx.y is the index of the thread in the y-direction within the block
since it is multiplied by 2, that mean its max width in the y-direction is 2

Hence, the number of threads in the block is 3 * 2 = 6
